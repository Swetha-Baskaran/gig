                <p class="para">Have you herd about freelancing jobs even it was been so much popular in the COVID-19 pandamic stage . All of this jobs comes under the GIG category.The gig economy works much the same way (without the need to carry a tune). Instead of a traditional, in-office, full-time job with a single company, gig workers work as short-term, temporary, or independent contractors for one or a variety of employers (though they are not employers in the traditional sense).<br><br>

Though the term “gig economy” is relatively new, these nontraditional work arrangements have been around a long time. A study by the American Staffing Association found that the majority of Americans (78%) see the gig economy as a new way to describe the participation of this longstanding independent workforce.</p>

                <p class="para">A gig economy is a free and global market where companies and contractors (independent workers) set short-term and on-demand professional relationships that are both flexible and skill-based.
In other words, digital platforms like Upwork or Fiverr have been allowing a big number of freelancers (or people with a fulltime job wanting to make extra money) to show their skillset. On the other hand, businesses can choose specialized staff from all over the world. This allows them to afford expensive skills for a short period or to have low recruitment and selection costs as there’s a large pool of candidates to choose from.</p>

Gig workers can be dispatched at a moment’s notice, receive notifications via mobile tech, and upload completed work. Simple as that. </p>

But it is is not sufficient for them .<br><br> He is good at home gardenning. Then my friend got an idea of why don't to start a freelancing bussiness on selling organic seeds and plants at a resonable cost . Some ideas too have scrolled on his mind . First he started with a very very little investements along with his family members . He got some profit even at the first attempt . Then it had given him a hope to continue it long .
